Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste. While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely precipitated by a cytokine storm, multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots. The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 
Covid-19 is seriously affecting Pakistan. Pakistan is in the third face of Coronavirus, but it has limited facilities to tackle the virus. Power BI is a powerful visualization tool that helps us to understand the whole condition. Pakistan's COVID-19 visualizations try to cover all the important aspects of the dataset using dashboards to represent the situation of Covid-19 in overall country, provinces, and cities.
